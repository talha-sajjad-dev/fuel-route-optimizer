"""POST /api/v1/routes/plan — thin DRF view.

All orchestration lives in RoutePlanService; all provider-failure/not-found
translation happens here, at the API boundary, exactly once. This view does
not construct providers, call the optimizer, or touch the database itself.

`build_route_plan_service` is imported as a module-level name specifically
so tests can replace it with `@patch("routes.api.views.build_route_plan_service")`
without touching Django settings or real HTTP/DB — see
routes/tests/test_api_route_plan.py.
