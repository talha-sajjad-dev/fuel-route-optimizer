"""Integration tests against the ACTUAL supplied data/fuel-prices.csv and
the real data/station_coordinates.csv enrichment fixture — not a synthetic
8-row sample. These prove the full pipeline (CSV import -> coordinate
enrichment -> repository -> geospatial selection -> optimizer -> API) works
against genuine assessment data, not just hand-built test fixtures.

No live Nominatim/OSRM call is made here — OSRM is mocked with the REAL
distance (544.68mi) this corridor was confirmed to produce in a live smoke
test (see the Phase 8 report), so the scenario stays realistic without
requiring network access for pytest.
