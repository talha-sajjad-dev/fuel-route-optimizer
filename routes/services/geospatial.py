"""Framework-independent geospatial station selection.

Turns a route's GeoJSON geometry plus a list of candidate stations into an
ordered list of `StationCandidate`s, using Shapely + pyproj for all distance
and position math. No Django ORM, no HTTP, no PostGIS — this module can be
unit tested with nothing but synthetic coordinates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distance rule (this is the most important thing to get right in this file):

Two distinct distance concepts come out of this module, and they must never
be confused with each other:

- `route_position_miles` — the station's position along the Shapely-
  projected polyline. Used ONLY for ordering and corridor-membership
  (perpendicular distance). NOT guaranteed to agree with OSRM's
  authoritative road distance, since OSRM's geometry is a simplified
  overview polyline whose own length can differ from the real road
  distance it represents.
- `travel_distance_miles` — the station's AUTHORITATIVE distance from the
  route's start, derived from OSRM's own per-segment distances
  (`Route.segment_distances_miles`, requested via `annotations=distance` on
  the same single routing call — see routes/services/routing.py). This is
  the ONLY distance the fuel optimizer (Phase 6) may use.

How `travel_distance_miles` is computed WITHOUT a route-wide scale factor:
a station's nearest point on the polyline falls between two consecutive
geometry vertices, say i and i+1. OSRM gives us the EXACT authoritative
road distance covered by every full segment (`segment_distances_miles[i]`
for each i). The only thing that needs any approximation at all is the
station's fractional position WITHIN that one single segment — computed
from the (local) ratio of Shapely-projected distances to vertex i and
vertex i+1, not from the route's total length. So:

    travel_distance_miles = cumulative_osrm_distance[i]
                             + local_fraction * segment_distances_miles[i]

Every full segment behind the station uses OSRM's own exact number; only
the remainder within one (typically short) segment is ever interpolated.
This is a fundamentally smaller and differently-scoped approximation than
a single `osrm_total / projected_total` ratio applied to the whole route
(explicitly rejected in an earlier phase, because it assumes any
discrepancy is uniformly distributed along the route) — here, the error is
bounded by the length of one polyline segment, never by the route's total
discrepancy.
