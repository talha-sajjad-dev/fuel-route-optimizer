"""Application-layer exceptions raised by RoutePlanService.

These are distinct from the provider exceptions in exceptions.py:
provider exceptions describe "what went wrong talking to Nominatim/OSRM";
these describe "what went wrong with this specific route-plan request,
in terms the API layer can turn directly into a response." RoutePlanService
translates a provider's LocationNotFoundError into
RoutePlanLocationNotFoundError (adding which field — start or destination —
failed), and leaves genuine provider failures (timeouts, 5xx, malformed
responses) to propagate as-is, since the view maps those straight to 502.
