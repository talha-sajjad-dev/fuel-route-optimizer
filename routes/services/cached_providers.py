"""Caching decorators around GeocodingProvider/RoutingProvider.

On a cache hit, the wrapped provider is never called — tests assert this
directly via call counts on a mock provider. On a miss, the provider is
called once, the result is validated (providers raise before returning
anything malformed — see routing.py/geocoding.py), and only then stored.

Race safety: two concurrent cache misses both call the provider and both
attempt to write the same cache_key. `get_or_create` handles the resulting
unique-constraint race at the database level (Django catches the
IntegrityError internally and re-fetches), so no explicit locking is needed
here — simple, DB-safe, and sufficient for this assessment's scale.
